          "Description": "My family and my husband killed me. Because of the inheritance. Returning to the past, I made up my mind. “I have to protect my life and my inheritance.” Grand Duke Laperion of the cursed family. I offered him, who was not interested in property and women, a one year contract marriage. Now, all we have to do is get a divorce… “Lady, do you think you can leave me now?” My husband is weird. “Would you like a land or a mine? Or an empire?” “Sasha, did Theo do something wrong?” “Mom, don’t leave me.” “Sister… I can’t live without you.” Even my in-laws began to obsess over me.",
